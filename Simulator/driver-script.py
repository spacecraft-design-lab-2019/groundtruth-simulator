Driver Script

Initializes and runs groundtruth simulator.

Pseudocode:
    -initialize with starting position & velocity

    LOOP:
        -calculate environment
        -calculate forces and torques (dynamics)
        -integrate (kinematics)
        -obtain new position/velocity

        -model sensors with noise

        -FEED to controller
        -take input from controller
        -add noise
        -account for control input in dynamics
